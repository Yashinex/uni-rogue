Hello, and thank you for contributing in some way to my game, Uni-Rogue!

This is a basic [hopefully not for long though] roguelike based off of a tutorial from http://rogueliketutorials.com/. All credit regarding the development of this game is given to them, and if you have similar interests, please go to their site!

CURRENT FEATURES:

KNOWN BUGS:
- Procedural generation will occasionally generate a floor with only 1 room off map.
- Picking up items generates multiple messages.
